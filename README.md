### Hey im Thomas👋, and this is my first website

- As a professional in the field of web development, I am pleased to share that I have created **my first** website using **HTML and CSS**🙌🏼. Although my website currently has limited content, including information related to quality assurance terms, I am aware that this is a common experience for beginners who are primarily focused on mastering the fundamental concepts of web development.🐼

- To further enhance my website and make it more professional, I plan to incorporate a brief section that introduces quality assurance and explains its significance. This will include some **basic information** about common QA techniques and tools, which will provide my website visitors with a better understanding of the importance of QA and its impact on software development.

- I understand that continued learning and practice are essential to improving my web development skills, and I am committed to dedicating the necessary time and effort to achieve this goal. I look forward to incorporating additional content and features into my website as I continue to develop my skills and knowledge in this exciting field.
